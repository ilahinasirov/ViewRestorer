PostgreSQL View Script Extractor

A fast and lightweight console app that extracts all CREATE VIEW statements from a PostgreSQL backup file (backup.sql) and generates two ready-to-use scripts:

view_create_scripts.txt â†’ contains all CREATE VIEW statements.

view_drop_scripts.txt â†’ contains safe DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ... CASCADE statements in reverse order to handle dependencies correctly.

Why is it useful?

ðŸš€ Fast & simple â€“ run directly as a console app, no setup required.

ðŸ”Ž Automatically separates view definitions from a full database backup.

ðŸ›  Quickly recreate or drop views during migrations, testing, or debugging.

ðŸ“‚ Handles schema-qualified names (schema.view), defaults to public if missing.

ðŸ”„ Dependency-safe drop order (views are dropped in reverse sequence).

âœ… Portable: just requires .NET 6+ (or newer).

Usage
dotnet run -- <backup.sql>


Example:

dotnet run -- ./backup.sql


Output files:

view_create_scripts.txt

view_drop_scripts.txt

âœ” Perfect for developers, DBAs, and DevOps who need a quick and reliable way to manage PostgreSQL view scripts.
